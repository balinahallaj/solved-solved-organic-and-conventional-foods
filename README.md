The point of this assignment is to look at the cost of eating more organically. For this assignment, you are to go into the grocery store (any but think beyond stores like Whole Foods or Trader Joe’s to more common ones like Stop and Shop or Market Basket) and attempt to buy your normal amount of groceries but substitute brands to more organic/less chemically-inclined versions. While I don’t expect you to buy these groceries, I do expect you to write a list based upon your normal grocery selection (if you spend $50 usually, use this as your baseline) and then write what substitution you made and the price difference. The paper should have 6 columns and look something like this: (These should be horizontally across) Normal Grocery Brand Quantity Price Substitution Quantity Price
